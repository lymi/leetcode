/**
 *
 * There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. 
 * For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the
 * horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and
 * hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. Start is
 * always smaller than end. There will be at most 104 balloons.
 * An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis.
 * A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart â‰¤ x â‰¤ xend. 
 * There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot
 * keeps travelling up infinitely. The problem is to find the minimum number of
 * arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
